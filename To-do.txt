- Adding other physical distributions.

- Adding a way to automatically infer the maximum value for the pdf. This makes the rejection sampling easier to use.

- Adding phi dependence (for example to account for the East-West asymmetry).

- Allowing for rotations of theta (Currently stacking needs to be directly upward).
